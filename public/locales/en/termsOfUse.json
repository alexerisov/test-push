To use your Voucher, you will be required to enter\n      its unique code at the online checkout and use of such code will be deemed to confirm your agreement to this\n      Agreement and any special conditions attached to the Voucher.

DELIVERY<\/h2>\n    <div>\n      <p className={s.terms__text}>\n        <b>10.1 EatChefs Delivery Week.<\/b> EatChefs\u2019s \u201cDelivery Week\u201d begins on Saturday and runs through the\n        following Friday. The start of our Delivery Week means that new Meal Kits are available to be delivered in\n        your Meal Box.\n      <\/p>\n      <p className={s.terms__text}>\n        <b>10.2 Rolling Basis of Meal Selection. <\/b> You have the option of selecting the day you would like to\n        receive your Meal Box, and, if your specific subscription allows for Meal Kit selection, you also have the\n        option of selecting the specific Meal Kits you would like to receive, on a weekly basis. The day you select\n        to receive your first Meal Box will be the default. In subsequent weeks, if you do not make a change, your\n        Meal Box will arrive on the day you initially selected every week (unless you pause your order, pursuant to\n        these Terms, or there are extenuating circumstances, detailed in these Terms). If you choose to have your\n        delivery on another day for a specific week, that day will become the default, and subsequent weeks will\n        have your Meal Box arriving on the newly selected day.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Meal Kit selection and delivery day selection is on a rolling basis, and all selections \u201clock\u201d five days\n        prior to the delivery day. For example, if your subscription allows for Meal Kit selection and you receive\n        your Meal Box on Fridays, you will have to make your selection of Meal Kits you want included in your Meal\n        Box on Sunday by 11:59 PM CET. Your credit card or other payment source will then be charged the following\n        day. Similarly, if you want to change the delivery day, you will have to make your selection five days prior\n        to your new delivery day. For example, if you normally receive your Meal Box on Thursdays, but want to\n        receive your Meal Box on a Monday, you will have to make the change five days prior to Monday, which would\n        be the Wednesday of the previous week. Please note that the specific days in which a Meal Box can be\n        delivered varies by geographic region, and delivery on each day will not be available in all areas. If you\n        have any questions about your area and delivery, please contact Customer Care at info@eatchefs.com.\n      <\/p>\n      <p className={s.terms__text}>\n        <b>10.3 Deactivation Procedures.<\/b> Please note that the ability to change an order locks five days prior\n        to your scheduled delivery date. Therefore, if you wish to deactivate your Account and/or cancel or change\n        an order, you must do so before the day and time listed above for your respective delivery date. For\n        example, if you have a scheduled delivery date on Tuesday, you have until Thursday at 11:59 PM CET to cancel\n        your subscription. If you do so after the time listed for your delivery day, you will be charged and receive\n        your Meal Box for that week, and the cancellation will take effect for the following Delivery Week.

Additionally, pausing an order shall only apply to the\n        week in which you pause, and automatic deliveries will commence the following week, unless you choose to\n        pause the following week, subject to the details, above.\n      <\/p>\n      <p className={s.terms__text}>\n        <b>10.5 Delivery Specifics.<\/b> In the case of weather which inhibits the ability to make safe deliveries,\n        or other events beyond our control that interfere with our ability to deliver your order, we will attempt to\n        deliver your Order as soon as reasonably possible. In some cases, delivery may occur on a date other than\n        your scheduled delivery day.

RECEIPT OF THE MATERIALS AND FOOD PREPARATION<\/h2>\n    <p className={s.terms__text}>\n      EatChefs uses specific materials to refrigerate perishable items and also uses third party delivery companies\n      to deliver Meal Boxes to customers. Please note that you are responsible for reviewing the Meal Box upon\n      delivery and inspecting all of the Products contained within for any defects or other problems upon delivery.\n      If you are not home when your Meal Box is delivered, the Meal Box will be left at your door or in a common\n      area. Upon the completion of your review of the Meal Box, we recommend that you place all perishables in your\n      refrigerator to ensure the ingredients\u2019 integrity. All items are solely at your risk from the time of\n      delivery. As such, you are solely responsible for any preparatory steps, storage of the contents of any Meal\n      Kits, safe washing (we recommend that all fresh produce is washed prior to inclusion in any meal), and the\n      cooking of all the ingredients of the respective Meal Kits. We recommend that you use a thermometer to measure\n      the temperature of any poultry, fish, or meat products that arrive in the insulated portion of the Meal Box,\n      and, pursuant to General Dutch Food Guidelines, you should utilize said thermometer to ensure that chilled\n      foods are at (or below) 7 degrees Celsius and warm foods are above 60 degrees Celsius when delivered. EatChefs\n      recommends that all cooking instructions found in the recipe booklet be followed, and all seafood, meats, and\n      poultry should be cooked to at least the USDA\u2019s recommended internal temperatures (75 degrees Celsius for\n      poultry; 75 degrees Celsius for ground meats; 65 degrees Celsius for whole meats; and 65 degrees Celsius for\n      seafood). EatChefs recommends utilizing a food thermometer to verify internal temperatures. For more\n      information, please see the USDA\u2019s website or the website of the The Netherlands Food and Consumer Product\n      Safety Authority (NVWA), www.nvwa.nl).\n    <\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n  <div className={s.terms__textBlock}>\n    <h2 className={s.terms__subtitle}>13. RECIPE CARDS<\/h2>\n    <p className={s.terms__text}>\n      Additionally, please note that each Meal Kit will have a corresponding recipe card contained in the Meal Box.\n      If your Meal Box does not contain one or more of the corresponding recipe cards, you can refer to the Site and\n      App for the week\u2019s recipes. If you have any questions or concerns related to the recipe cards, please contact\n      info@eatchefs.com.\n    <\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n  <div className={s.terms__textBlock}>\n    <h2 className={s.terms__subtitle}>14.
